157876,Sensemaking and Organizing ,COG SCI 150,"When something ""makes sense” or "" is organized” we are imposing or discovering order in the arrangement of concepts, events, or resources of some kind.    Sensemaking and organizing are fundamental human activities that raise many multi- or trans-disciplinary questions about perception, knowledge, decision making, interaction with things and with other people, values and value creation. We will analyze sensemaking and organizing from four interrelated perspectives. The most fundamental one is provided by language and culture, which shapes the perspectives one takes as an individual, in institutional contexts governed by business or legal processes, or in data-intensive or scientific contexts.

Is the self, for example, identical to some part of the brain or part of the brain’s function?  Can you damage the self by damaging the brain?  In this course we will look at these questions from conceptual, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives.  We will study both normal and injured brains to help shed light on what is a deeply philosophical and personal issue: What is the human the self.

Questions to be discussed include: Are there instantaneous velocities? Are the laws of physics true, or are they just predictively useful approximations? Are forces like gravity real, or are they just mathematically convenient fictions? Is Newtonian mechanics really deterministic? Is space a thing (and what would that even mean)?

These observations lead to two of the basic questions of Social Choice Theory. First, what are good methods of group decision making in the face of conflicting preferences? Second, can we evaluate the overall social welfare of some alternative course of action in terms of the welfare of each individual in the group under that alternative?
